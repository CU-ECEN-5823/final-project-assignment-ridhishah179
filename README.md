# Envrionment Monitoring and Control

##### Group Members : Ridhi Shah, Vatsal Sheth, Amreeta Sengupta

## Project Status 

     Fire Sensor has been interfaced and Digital output pin is connected to pin 12 of the gpioPortD  and Analog output has been       
     GPIO interrupt was configured and the potentiometer value on the fire sensor was set such as to define an extreme value to a given     environmental situation and an interrupt is raised when the signal exceeds this extreme value. 
     For monitoring the continuous values on the fire sensor the analog output pin is used. ADC configuration has been done for 12-bit        ADC with 2.5 volts internal reference to read these analog values from the fire sensor. 
     The Alert message when extreme value is crossed has been sent to the friend using Generic ON/OFF model. 
     Generic Level Model has also been implemented to send fire sensor values to the friend node for continuous monitoring.
     Communication has been established between LPN and friend nodes and transmission of the alert message and data has been verified.


##### Checked repository contains the following code implementation:
     
     gpio.c - Contains GPIO configuration and interrupt handler for interrupts Enabled for Push button factory rest and PD12 Digital output               pin of the fire sensor
     gpio.h - Contains necessary header files and macro definitions for implementation of GPIO functions. 
     adc.c -  Contains 12-bit single mode ADC configuation and function to read ADC data from the CHx9 APORT of the ADC connected to the                 flame sensor analog output pin
     adc.h -  Contains necessary header files and macro definitions for implementation of ADC functions. 
     app.c -  Contains Bluetooth mesh implementation of the LPN node for communicating alert and data  with friend node using Generic                      ON/OFF and Generic Level model
     
      In addition to the above files the repository contains all the supporting files for bluetooth mesh implementation and SDK support.
